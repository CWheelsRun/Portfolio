# My Responsive Portfolio

A responsive portfolio showcasing what I've learned in HTML and CSS.

## Media Query for min-widths

Found 2 widths (1450 & 621) that acted as good benchmark instances for the screen to adjust some of its elements.

## Mobile-First

By using min-widths, the design is initially intended to be mapped for a mobile device.

The changes made in the media queries adjust the layout of elements in a way that makes them fit to a larger screen.

## The Drive & The Goal

This project showed me what I'm capable of in finding resources online to deliver a better, cleaner, more effective code.
It also revealed some shortcomings of mine, mainly my inner desire to be a perfectionist.

Ultimately, this will prove to be:
* A website I can use to showcase my abilities
* A portfolio to display to any future employers/clients
* A simple way for any prospects to learn about me or reach out
